# App Flow Document for naitive-engage-suite

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user first visits the application, they land on a welcoming page that prompts them to either sign in or create a new account. The landing page is accessed via the root URL and displays two clear links: one leading to the sign-in page and the other to the sign-up page. A user who chooses to register is taken to the sign-up view, where they enter their email address, choose a password, and submit the form. This form sends a POST request to the `/api/auth` endpoint, which validates the data, creates a new user record, and issues a session token stored in a secure HTTP-only cookie. After a successful registration, the user is automatically redirected to the dashboard home.

If an existing user selects the sign-in link, they land on the sign-in page and enter their credentials. Submitting the form also calls the `/api/auth` endpoint. The server checks the credentials against the stored records, and on success it returns a session token and redirects the user to the main dashboard. In the event of forgotten credentials, the current version does not include a password recovery page, but the architecture allows for that flow to be added in a future release. The user can always sign out by clicking the log-out button in the dashboard header, which clears the session token and takes them back to the sign-in page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Once authenticated, the user lands on the main dashboard view. The dashboard is composed of a persistent layout that includes a sidebar on the left and a top header bar. The sidebar offers navigation to the primary sections of the application, and the header shows the user’s name along with a log-out button. The central area of the screen is reserved for widgets and engagement metrics that display usage data, charts, and interactive elements. The dashboard’s styling comes from a dedicated theme file that sits alongside the dashboard layout, ensuring a consistent look and feel. From here, users can click on any of the sidebar items to navigate deeper into specific parts of the suite or return to the dashboard home at any time by clicking the logo in the header.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

### Authentication Flow

The authentication flow begins on either the sign-in or sign-up pages. The form submission triggers a call to the single authentication API route. On the server side, the route handler reads the request body, runs validation logic, and interacts with the data store to create or verify user credentials. If validation fails, the server returns an error response. The client reads the response, displays an inline error message above the form, and allows the user to correct their input. When credentials are valid, the server issues a cookie and the client performs a redirect to the dashboard.

### Registration Flow

During registration, the user fills in their details and submits the sign-up form. The request goes to the same API route as sign-in, but the route distinguishes between new-user creation and login by checking the HTTP method or a flag in the request. After creating the account, the server responds with a session token and the user is seamlessly redirected to the main dashboard. The UI immediately reflects the new user state and begins fetching personalized data.

### Dashboard Data Fetching and Interaction

The dashboard page uses a combination of server-side and client-side data fetching. On initial load, a server component reads from a static data file or makes API calls to gather default engagement metrics. This allows the page to render quickly with placeholder or cached data. Once the page is hydrated in the browser, client-side code issues live requests to the API for up-to-date information. Users can interact with filters, date pickers, and refresh buttons to update the displayed charts. Each interaction triggers a new API call, and the UI updates without a full page reload to maintain a smooth and responsive experience.

## Settings and Account Management

Currently, the primary account management action available to users is signing out. The log-out button in the header clears the authentication cookie and sends the user back to the sign-in screen. There is no dedicated profile settings page in this initial version, but the global layout includes provision for additional menu items in the sidebar or header. Future enhancements may add a settings section where users can update personal details, change passwords, or configure notification preferences. After making any changes in a hypothetical settings flow, users would be redirected back to the dashboard to continue their work.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If a user enters invalid data on the sign-in or sign-up page, the API returns a clear JSON error response. The form component displays this message directly beneath the input field, guiding the user to correct mistakes. In the event of a network failure, the UI shows a banner in the header area indicating connectivity loss and temporarily disables actions until the connection is restored. When an unauthenticated user tries to access the dashboard by entering its URL directly, the server automatically redirects them to the sign-in page. Any server errors during data fetching on the dashboard display a friendly message in the widget area, along with a retry button, so the user can attempt the action again.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the moment a user discovers the application to their daily visits, the journey follows a clear path. A newcomer lands on the home page, chooses to sign up, and immediately gets redirected into a personalized dashboard. Returning users sign in with familiar credentials and step straight into their interactive home screen. Within the dashboard, server-side rendering ensures fast initial loads, while client-side updates keep metrics fresh. Error messages and redirects protect the user experience, guiding them back to a valid state when needed. The log-out action provides a simple exit, securely ending the session and returning the user to the sign-in prompt. Together, these flows form a cohesive and predictable cycle of engagement and productivity.
