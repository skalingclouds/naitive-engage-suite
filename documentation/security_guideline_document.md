# Security Guidelines for naitive-engage-suite

## 1. Introduction & Scope
These guidelines define security best practices for the `naitive-engage-suite` Next.js application. They cover secure design, implementation, and operations to protect user data and maintain platform integrity. All team members should adhere to these principles throughout development, testing, and deployment.

## 2. Threat Model & Risk Overview
- **Unauthorized Access**: Attackers may attempt to bypass authentication or escalate privileges.
- **Injection Attacks**: Malicious input could compromise APIs or database.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Improper encryption or logging might leak PII or credentials.
- **Cross-Site Attacks**: XSS, CSRF, clickjacking harming users’ sessions.
- **Configuration & Dependency Risks**: Default settings or outdated libraries open vulnerabilities.

## 3. Security by Design & Governance
- Embed security in every phase: planning, code reviews, testing, and deployment.
- Adopt an agile threat assessment for new features.
- Maintain an up-to-date security policy and coding standards reference.
- Conduct regular peer and automated security reviews (SAST, DAST).

## 4. Authentication & Access Control
- **Strong Authentication**:
  - Use NextAuth.js or a comparable library with established patterns.
  - Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin or sensitive roles.
- **Password Policies**:
  - Require minimum length (≥12 chars), complexity, and rotation reminders.
  - Hash passwords with bcrypt/Argon2 and unique salts.
- **Session Management**:
  - Issue HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite=strict cookies.
  - Enforce idle (e.g., 15 min) and absolute (e.g., 8 hr) timeouts.
  - Invalidate sessions on logout or password change.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Define roles (e.g., user, manager, admin) and least-privilege permissions.
  - Perform server-side checks on every protected API route and page.

## 5. Input Handling & Output Encoding
- **General Validation**:
  - Validate all inputs on the server using a schema library (zod, Joi).
  - Reject unknown or unexpected fields.
- **Preventing Injection**:
  - Use parameterized queries or ORM (Prisma, TypeORM).
  - Sanitize any dynamic queries in API routes (avoid string concatenation).
- **XSS Mitigation**:
  - Encode user-supplied data in React (default JSX escaping).
  - Use a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) header.
- **CSRF Protection**:
  - Leverage Next.js built-in CSRF tokens or a third-party solution.
- **File Uploads** (if applicable):
  - Restrict file types, scan content, store outside public folder.

## 6. Data Protection & Privacy
- **Encryption in Transit & At Rest**:
  - Enforce HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ across all endpoints.
  - Encrypt any stored PII or tokens with AES-256.
- **Secrets Management**:
  - Store environment variables (keys, DB credentials) in a vault or platform secret store.
  - Never commit secrets to Git; enforce pre-commit secrets scanning.
- **Logging & Monitoring**:
  - Log only non-sensitive metadata (timestamps, event types).
  - Mask or truncate PII in logs.
  - Monitor logs for anomalous behavior (failed logins, rate-limit triggers).

## 7. API & Service Security
- **Versioning & Rate Limiting**:
  - Prefix routes with version (`/api/v1/auth`, `/api/v1/dashboard`).
  - Implement rate limiting (e.g., 100 req/min per IP) to prevent abuse.
- **Authorization for Every Endpoint**:
  - Ensure middleware validates session/token and scopes.
  - Return HTTP 401/403s appropriately.
- **CORS Configuration**:
  - Allow only trusted origins; avoid wildcard `*` in production.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Fail securely: return generic error messages to clients.
  - Log detailed stack traces only to internal logs.

## 8. Web Application Security Hygiene
- **Security Headers** (via Next.js `headers()` config):
  - `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
  - `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade`
- **Subresource Integrity (SRI)**:
  - Add `integrity` attributes for any CDN scripts/styles.
- **Client Storage**:
  - Avoid localStorage for tokens; rely on secure cookies.
- **Disable Dev Mode in Production**:
  - Ensure `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` toggles debug off.

## 9. Infrastructure & Configuration Management
- **Server Hardening**:
  - Disable unused ports and services on deployment VMs or containers.
  - Disable default accounts and change admin passwords.
- **TLS Configuration**:
  - Use strong cipher suites and disable TLS <1.2.
  - Renew certificates automatically (e.g., Let’s Encrypt).
- **File Permissions**:
  - Limit file system access to application user only.
  - Restrict config and log directories.

## 10. Dependency Management
- **Secure Dependencies**:
  - Vet all NPM packages; prefer well-maintained libraries.
  - Lock dependency versions in `package-lock.json`.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**:
  - Integrate SCA tools (Snyk, GitHub Dependabot) in CI.
  - Address high and critical CVEs before deployment.
- **Minimal Footprint**:
  - Remove unused packages to reduce attack surface.

## 11. CI/CD & DevOps Security
- **Pipeline Protection**:
  - Enforce signed commits and branch protection rules.
  - Require code review and passing security checks before merge.
- **Secrets in CI**:
  - Use built-in secret stores (GitHub Actions secrets, GitLab CI variables).
- **Automated Testing**:
  - Run unit, integration, and dynamic security tests (DAST) in pipeline.
- **Immutable Infrastructure**:
  - Deploy via container images or infrastructure-as-code with versioning.

## 12. Ongoing Maintenance & Monitoring
- **Periodic Penetration Testing** to validate defenses.
- **Rotate Secrets** on schedule or after personnel changes.
- **Incident Response Plan** detailing steps for breach detection and recovery.
- **Security Awareness**: Regular training for developers on OWASP Top Ten and emerging threats.
