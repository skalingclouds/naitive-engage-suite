# Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

`naitive-engage-suite` is a web application built with Next.js and TypeScript that provides a secure user authentication system and an interactive dashboard for visualizing engagement metrics. Its primary goal is to let users sign up, sign in, and then view real-time or pre-fetched data about user interactions, marketing KPIs, or internal platform usage. By combining server-side rendering (SSR) for fast first loads and client-side hydration for interactivity, the suite delivers a responsive, SaaS-style experience.

We’re building this platform to give product and marketing teams an easy-to-use tool for tracking engagement without having to set up their own infrastructure. Key objectives include:
- Secure and robust authentication (sign-up, sign-in) with proper validation and session management.
- A clean, consistent dashboard UI that displays data from a static JSON file (and eventually a database).
- Modular, feature-sliced code organization to support future growth (new analytics, additional API routes).
- Performance targets: sub-2-second initial load and sub-200ms API response times for core routes.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope (Version 1):**
- User registration (sign-up) form and flow.
- User login (sign-in) form and flow.
- Protected dashboard route accessible only by authenticated users.
- Dashboard page that loads static data from `data.json` and renders charts or lists.
- Next.js API route at `/api/auth/route.ts` handling both sign-up and sign-in requests, returning session tokens.
- Global styling (`globals.css`) and dashboard theming (`theme.css`).
- Basic client-side and server-side input validation and error handling.

**Out-of-Scope (for Now):**
- Integration with a real database or external storage (we rely on `data.json` for data in v1).
- Third-party login providers (OAuth, social sign-in).
- Multi-step onboarding or user profile management.
- Complex analytics: filtering, date-range selection, drill-downs.
- Role-based access control or multi-tenant features.
- Mobile native apps or a dedicated mobile-responsive overhaul.
- Versioned API endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/...`).

## 3. User Flow

A new visitor lands on the homepage (redirects to `/sign-in` if unauthenticated). They click “Sign Up” to create an account, fill in email and password fields, and submit. The form posts to `/api/auth`, which validates inputs and creates a session token. On success, the user is redirected automatically to `/dashboard`. Any errors (e.g., invalid email, password too short) appear inline.

An authenticated user sees the dashboard layout with a left sidebar, top header (with a “Sign Out” button), and main content. The page component fetches static data from `data.json` via a server component or client fetch, then renders engagement metrics (charts, tables). Clicking “Sign Out” clears the session and redirects them back to `/sign-in`. Attempting to access `/dashboard` without a valid session always redirects to `/sign-in`.

## 4. Core Features

- **Authentication API (`/api/auth/route.ts`)**
  • Handles POST requests for both sign-up and sign-in in a single endpoint.
  • Validates email format and password strength.
  • Issues a JWT or session cookie on successful authentication.
  • Returns JSON error messages on failures.

- **Sign-Up Page (`/app/sign-up/page.tsx`)**
  • Form with email and password fields.
  • Client-side validation (required, email regex, minimum password length).
  • Calls the Auth API and handles responses.

- **Sign-In Page (`/app/sign-in/page.tsx`)**
  • Similar form and validation as sign-up.
  • Posts credentials to Auth API.
  • On success, redirects to the dashboard.

- **Root Layout (`/app/layout.tsx`)**
  • Defines global HTML structure (head tags, common meta).
  • Loads `globals.css` for base typography and layout.

- **Dashboard Layout (`/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`)**
  • Renders navigation sidebar and header with sign-out control.
  • Loads `theme.css` for dashboard-specific styling.

- **Dashboard Page (`/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)**
  • Server or client component that fetches static data.
  • Displays engagement metrics in charts or lists.
  • Error handling if data fails to load.

- **Static Data File (`data.json`)**
  • Contains default or mock engagement metrics used for initial render.
  • Consumed by dashboard server component at build or runtime.

- **Styling**
  • `globals.css` for site-wide styles (fonts, colors, resets).
  • `theme.css` for dashboard overrides (widget layouts, color accents).

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

- **Frontend & Backend Framework:** Next.js (App Router) with React 18+ and Server Components.
- **Language:** TypeScript everywhere (`.tsx`, `.ts`).
- **Styling:** Plain CSS files (`globals.css`, `theme.css`). Optional future migration to CSS Modules or Tailwind.
- **API Layer:** Next.js API routes for serverless endpoints.
- **Data Handling:** Static JSON (`data.json`) now; future plans for a database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
- **Dev Environment:** Node.js 18+, Yarn or npm.
- **IDE & Plugins:** VS Code with ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript integration.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**<br>  • Initial page load (sign-in or dashboard) under 2 seconds on a 3G connection.<br>  • API response for auth under 200ms.
- **Security:**<br>  • All endpoints served over HTTPS.<br>  • JWT or cookie-based sessions with secure, HTTP-only flags.<br>  • CSRF protection on state-changing requests.<br>  • Input sanitization to prevent XSS and injection.
- **Usability:**<br>  • Responsive design for desktop and tablet; basic mobile friendliness.<br>  • Easy-to-read forms with clear error messages.
- **Accessibility:**<br>  • Form fields with labels, keyboard navigable, color contrast WCAG AA.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

- **Constraints:**<br>  • No production database; relies on local/stubbed data (`data.json`).<br>  • Single API route for auth may need splitting later.<br>  • Hosting on a platform that supports Next.js serverless (Vercel, Netlify).
- **Assumptions:**<br>  • Environment variables for JWT secret or session keys are available.<br>  • Developers have Node.js 18+ installed.<br>  • Future backend storage will adopt a similar API structure.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

- **Static Data Limitation:**<br>  • Relying on `data.json` means no real-time updates; plan to swap in database calls once available.
- **API Overloading:**<br>  • Single `/api/auth` route may become complex; consider splitting into `/api/auth/signup` and `/api/auth/signin` in later versions.
- **Error Handling Gaps:**<br>  • Ensure all fetches (dashboard, auth) catch and display errors gracefully to avoid blank screens.
- **Session Persistence:**<br>  • JWT expiry and token refresh not covered; future phases should add refresh tokens.
- **CSS Scalability:**<br>  • Flat CSS files may collide as the app grows; consider migrating to a CSS-in-JS or utility-first framework.

**Mitigation Suggestions:**<br>• Build a simple service layer for data fetching to abstract JSON vs. DB logic.<br>• Implement rate limiting or debouncing on auth requests.<br>• Add end-to-end tests for sign-up, sign-in, and dashboard load flows early.
